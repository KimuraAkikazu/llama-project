The best answer is C. ...-s syndrome (Turner syndrome) and the XYY chromosome pattern are examples of aneuploidy in males; these conditions result from the presence of one or more extra chromosomes, respectively. The disorders that occur due to aneuploidy involve having too many or too few copies of a specific chromosome, leading to various developmental and health issues. For example: ...-s syndrome (Turner syndrome) is characterized by short stature, infertility in women with the condition, and other physical features such as heart defects. Hemophilia A and B are genetic disorders that cause excessive bleeding due to lack or low levels of clotting factors VIII or IX; these conditions are X-linked recessive traits. Cystic fibrosis is a disease that affects the respiratory and digestive systems, caused by mutations in the CFTR gene on chromosome 7. Tay-Sachs disease is a rare genetic disorder that causes progressive destruction of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, resulting from an autosomal recessive mutation on chromosome 15. Therefore, Turner syndrome (option C) is most likely to result from X-chromosome aneuploidy in women.

The correct answer is C, which means option D does not belong to this question. So you should find another solution for option D.
Option A: The genetic basis of X-linked disorders is the presence of a defective gene on the X chromosome that leads to disease manifestation in males and females differently according to their sex chromosomes. Males have one X and one Y chromosome, while females have two X chromosomes but no Y chromosome. Therefore, if an individual inherits an abnormal allele for a particular gene located on the X chromosome from either parent, it can lead to the development of a genetic disorder.
Option B: This is not correct because sex-linked disorders are inherited via the X and Y chromosomes. Females typically have two copies of each gene (one on each X chromosome) while males have one copy of most genes (on their single X chromosome). Therefore, if a female has two abnormal alleles for a particular gene located on the X chromosome, she can still be asymptomatic or show milder symptoms compared to her male counterparts who would express the disease due to having only one functioning allele.
Option C: This is correct because sex-linked disorders result from mutations in genes located on the X chromosome that affect males and females differently according to their sex chromosomes. Females typically have two copies of each gene (one on each X chromosome) while males have one copy of most genes (on their single X chromosome). Therefore, if a female has an abnormal allele for a particular gene located on the X chromosome, she can still be asymptomatic or show milder symptoms compared to her male counterparts who would express the disease due to having only one functioning allele.
Option D: This is not correct because sex-linked disorders are inherited via the X and Y chromosomes. Females typically have two copies of each gene (one on each X chromosome) while males have one copy of most genes (on their single X chromosome). Therefore, if a female has an abnormal allele for a particular gene located on the other parent's non-mutated allele, she will be asymptomatic or show milder symptoms compared to her male counterparts who would express the disease due to having only one functioning allele.
Therefore, this option is not correct because sex-linked disorders are inherited via the X and Y chromosomes. Females typically have two copies of each gene (one on each X chromosome) while males have one copy of most genes (on their single X chromosome). Therefore, if a female has an abnormal allele for a particular gene located on the other parent's non-mutated allele, she will be asymptomatic or show milder symptoms compared to her male counterparts who would express the disease due to having only one functioning allele.

The final answer is C.  {"reasoning": "", "answer": ""}. 
Explanation: In this question, we are asked about sex-linked disorders and their inheritance patterns. Sex-linked disorders result from mutations in genes located on the X chromosome that affect males and females differently according to their sex chromosomes.
In option A, it mentions that genetic basis of X-linked disorders is the presence of a defective gene on the X chromosome that leads to disease manifestation in males and females differently according to their sex chromosomes. However, this is not entirely correct because it implies that both sexes can express the disease due to having an abnormal allele for a particular gene located on the X chromosome.
Option B mentions that if an individual inherits an abnormal allele for a particular gene located on the X chromosome from either parent, it can lead to the development of a genetic disorder. This is partially correct because females typically have two copies of each gene (one on each X chromosome), but it does not address how sex-linked disorders affect males and females differently.
Option C states that sex-linked disorders result from mutations in genes located on the X chromosome that affect males and females differently according to their sex chromosomes. Females typically have two copies of each gene (one on each X chromosome) while males have one copy of most genes (on their single X chromosome). Therefore, if a female has an abnormal allele for a particular gene located on the other parent's non-mutated allele, she will be asymptomatic or show milder symptoms compared to her male counterparts who would express the disease due to having only one functioning allele. This is correct because it addresses how sex
