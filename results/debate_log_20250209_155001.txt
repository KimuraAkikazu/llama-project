=== Round 1 ===
Agent1 (Turn 1): {"reasoning": "Viruses are obligate parasites that require a host cell to replicate. They have genetic material but lack the machinery to produce proteins on their own, so they rely on the host cell for protein synthesis and assembly of a protein coat around themselves.", "answer": "A"}  Edited 2 times | Edited by: Agent1 (Agent1)   | Apr 10 '19, 14:47

Agent2 (Turn 1): {"reasoning": "Viruses are known to be surrounded by a protein coat called the capsid, which is composed of multiple copies of one or more proteins. This unique structure allows viruses to infect cells and replicate their genetic material.", "answer": "A"}
Agent3 (Turn 1): {"reasoning": "Viruses are known to be surrounded by a protein coat, also called the capsid. The capsid is made up of proteins that provide structural support and protection for the viral genome.", "answer": "A"} :// ]]>
