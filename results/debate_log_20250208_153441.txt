--- MMLU Q1 ---
Question: Members of which of the following groups are most likely to be surrounded by a protein coat?
A. Viruses
B. Bacteria
C. Eukaryotes
D. Archaea

=== Round 1 ===
Agent1 (Turn 1): {"answer": "A", "reasoning": "Viruses are composed of a protein coat, also known as a capsid, which surrounds the viral genome. This protein coat provides protection to the viral genome and allows it to infect host cells. In contrast, bacteria are single-celled organisms that do not have a protein coat surrounding their cell membrane. Eukaryotes and Archaea are also single-celled organisms that do not have a protein coat surrounding their cell membrane."}
Agent2 (Turn 1): {"reasoning": "Viruses are known to be surrounded by a protein coat called a capsid. This is a defining characteristic of viruses. Bacteria, eukaryotes, and archaea do not have this characteristic. Therefore, members of the group that are most likely to be surrounded by a protein coat are viruses.", "answer": "A"}
