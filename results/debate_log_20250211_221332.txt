--- MMLU Q1 ---
Question: Members of which of the following groups are most likely to be surrounded by a protein coat?
A. Viruses
B. Bacteria
C. Eukaryotes
D. Archaea

=== Round 1 ===
Agent1 (Turn 1): {
"reasoning": "Viruses are known to be surrounded by a protein coat, also called the capsid. The capsid is composed of multiple copies of one or more proteins, and it provides structural support for the virus.",
"answer": "A"
}
Agent2 (Turn 1): {"reasoning": "Viruses are obligate parasites that require a host cell to replicate. They have genetic material, but they do not have the ability to perform metabolic functions on their own. As a result, viruses need to hijack the host cell's machinery to replicate and produce more viral particles. To protect themselves from being degraded by enzymes in the host cell or attacked by immune cells, viruses are surrounded by a protein coat called a capsid. The capsid provides structural support and helps to shield the genetic material of the virus from environmental stresses.", "answer": "A"}
